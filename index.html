    <!-- ABOUT ME TEXT -->
    <p style="text-align:left; font-size:15px">
            
            Hi there! I live in Berlin and study Master Computer Science at FU Berlin. I obtained Bachelor of Computer Engineering at Beuth's University of Applied Sciences. I wrote a Bachelor Thesis during lockdown in spring 2020 accompained with my small kid who could not go to a kindergarten because of pandemic restrictions. I defenced the thesis in February 2021 and I switched to FU Berlin to continue study as a master student.<br><br>

            Today I work as a student assistant at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute HHI and I am going to finish a master thesis this year. My interest lies in practical usage of Machine Learning Algorithms, creating an IoT Software and programming in Python as backend developer. I have experience with Django, Python, C, I have created embedded software for ESP32 and ARM Cortex. I learn fast by doing and I am self motivated to be a good developer and a good engineer.<br><br>
            
            Since I have previously worked as a UI designer, I decided to present some of designs on the website. In my opinion, software engineering field can benefit from engineers who are able to evaluate and design a better user experience. I'm fond of not only developing the embedded software systems but also design interactions between a user and software.
